# MaxMSP_Vowel_Synthesizer
In this MaxMSP patch users can listen to the audio of vowels from the vowel database provided by the UT Dallas and try to recreate them by changing the values of the formants F1, F2, F3 and F4.
The values of the formants were extracted in Praat.
The creators of the vowel database are Peter F. Assmann & William Katz.
